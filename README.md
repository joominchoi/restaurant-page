## Thoughts

## Learnings
- Setting active and inactive components by the addition and removal of classes
- I initially thought that the above will allow me to replicate the function explained in the first
point in the recapping section below. I believe this is achievable but I think it will be
overengineering and I kept the removal and addition of the 'active' classname of the active tab
just for reference.

## Recapping
- Removing content from one tab to be replaced by content from another tab does not have to be
overcomplicated or overengineered. It can be as simple as setting the main.textContent = "" and then
appending desired content with  main.appendChild(createHome())
